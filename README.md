# Lox programming language
- Slight deviation from the Crafting Interpreters book written by Robert Nystrom
- VM implemented in Go
- Syntax of the language adapter to be more Lua-ish
- Unfinished

## TODO
- Drop the ';' tokken, so we can use new line character as delimiter
- Improve branch (`elif`) parsing
- Add support for anonymous functions
- Add support for multiple return values
- Improve parsing and runtime error output
